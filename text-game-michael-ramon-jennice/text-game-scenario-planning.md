LEARN academy: include questions from 
Teachers and TAs as bosses, challenge them to duels then they challenge us with coding questions.
Students as NPCs and helpers, and students pets

Setting:
Medieval Fantasy setting?
The Kingdom of Ruby

You are a Junior Developer Knight
Trying to become the Ruby lord
The ruby ring has been split into shards and you need to collect the shards to become the ruby lord.

The Ruby shard bearers are teachers and TAs
To challenge them to take their shards you answer their code quizzes

Game mechanics:
Make the teachers come to us
They ask us Ruby code quizzes as a fight
Progress game by typing walk forward (or yes no?)
When you defeat a boss they say something and then leave, and the next boss comes in.
If you lose, you get expelled from LEARN academy and never code again.
“YOU DIED”

Beau
     
“How many primitive data types are there?”

In the distance music can be heard, gets louder as it approaches.

Da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da

Let it never by said that romance is dead
Cause there’s so little else occupying my head
There is nothing I need, kept the function to breathe
But I’m not really fussed, doesn’t matter to me

Ruby, ruby, ruby, ruby (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Sarah struts in with her boombox wearing a Ruby crown as she is the current Ruby lord

“Hello young junior developer knight. You defeated everyone up til now except for me. Do you have what it takes to defeat me and become the Ruby lord?”

“What does MINASWAN stand for?” 
Matz is nice so we are nice: “yes Matz is nice so we are nice, Matz has a very kind demeanor so we treat one another with dignity and respect; we are good to ourselves; and we are good to the codebase itself.“ Sarah takes some damage. 
Anything else “you are not ready to be the Ruby Lord”
Blasts *ruby ruby ruby*

“What is the datatype for the “key” in a key: value pair?”

“Symbol: “good job, junior dev knight”
Anything else “you are not ready to be the Ruby Lord”
Blasts *ruby ruby ruby*

What language is ruby-on-rails written in?
Ruby: "very good, junior dev knight. It is an honor to be bested by the new Ruby Lord."

Sarah passes the boombox and the Ruby crown to you.

You become the new Ruby Lord.

You walk towards the glowing PostgreSQL tree and the boombox blares as you take your place on the Ruby throne.
